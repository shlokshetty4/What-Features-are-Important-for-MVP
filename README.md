# MVP Prediction Model

# Overview

This project predicts whether an NFL quarterback will win the MVP award based on performance metrics. It uses machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression and random forest classification, to make predictions.

Dataset

The dataset contains various performance statistics of quarterbacks. The last two rows have missing MVP values, which are dropped before training the model.
